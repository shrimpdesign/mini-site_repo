        <p> Welcome! This is the arts and crafts online showcase, 
            HandmadeCrafters, featuring ceramics and crochet projects. 
            We are hoping for you guys to learn a little more about the 
            process of creating crochet and ceramics projects. They both 
            are different in their processes but are both very hands-on 
            and are very rewarding when completed. Welcome again! Feel 
            free to explore our website and enjoy all the art pieces! 
        </p>
